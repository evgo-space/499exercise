repository for class assignment to demo basic git skills. Features a sorted array in java.

This is a basic program to demo github skills.

I have implemented an array sort which allows the user to choose between either integers or characters, the user then is prompted to enter a string of any length of exclusively integers or characters, the program then sorts and returns the array.

Simple tests were created within vs code to insure that the input string is correctly sorted.
